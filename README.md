# <p align="center">Real-Time Chat App</p>

A simple real-time chat application built to explore and understand how real-time communication and webhooks work in a full-stack environment. The application allows users to see who is currently online, chat in real time, and switch between different UI themes. 
The project is intentionally kept minimal, with the main focus on learning and experimenting with real-time data flow, sockets, and deployment.
